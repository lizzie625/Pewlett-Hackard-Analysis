# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Deliverables  
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:
* Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title  
* Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program  
* Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)  
## Overview  
We are helping Bobby prepare for his analysis using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to create a database and work with the imported data. We are looking to prepare Pewlett-Howard for the upcoming retirements in the company, and the job openings that will thus occur. We are going to look closely at how many people will be retiring in upcoming years and how many positions will need to be filled. Using an ERD, we used PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to create a database and tables; we then used SQL to join tables and import CSV's. 
## Results  
* 72458 employees are expected to retire, making that many roles becoming available.  
* 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.  
* The majority of retirees are in "Senior" level positions.  
* There are very few Manager positions that will need to be filled with the upcoming retirment wave.  

## Summary  
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?  
* According to the analysis, over 70,000 positions will need to be filled to make up for the employees nearing retirement.  
  
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?  
* 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program, this does not fill the need of opening jobs that will be coming with the "silver tsunami".
